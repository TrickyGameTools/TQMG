# TQMG

For now MonoGame appears the quickest way to go, do do some things in C# when it comes to graphics screen, but I will be honest, I do not fully like it.
But why suffer if you can make things a bit easier on yourself, eh?

These routines were only written for my own benefit, so do not expect full documentation on them, but as my MonoGame projects WILL rely on them, I will release these sources, as you will need them to compile the stuff I wrote with them.

TQMG relies heavily on JCR6 and my TrickyUnits. So these should always be present, read below


# Needs

What goes for ANY project using these routines is that you will require to make one folder dedicated to my work and then form that folder:

~~~sh
git clone Tricky1975/TrickyUnits_CSharp TrickyUnits
git clone jcr6/jcr6_csharp JCR6
git clone TrickyGameTools/TQMG
~~~
